{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"apprenticeship","contentHtml":"<p>After applying to many apprenticeships and considering paying for bootcamps with a stroke of luck I received good news! I was accepted into, and will gladly be participating in, a full stack developer apprenticeship program courtesy of the <strong>Discovery Partners Institute’s TechReady Illinois</strong>, <strong>Cognizant</strong>, and the <strong>City Colleges of Chicago</strong>. I will begin by learning Java in a three and a half month bootcamp course at Wright College, part of the CCC. After, I will interview for an apprenticeship position at Cognizant where I will get to learn fulltime alongside a dedicated mentor and experienced colleagues for another three months.  At the conclusion of the apprenticeship, I will get the <strong>opportunity to interview</strong> for a full stack developer position with Cognizant.</p>\n<p>This apprenticeship is a once in a lifetime opportunity to change careers and become confidently reskilled as a software developer. After learning software development on my own for ten months I am looking forward learning and building applications with a peer group as well as asking instructors and mentors the questions that would usually take me hours to resolve.</p>\n<p>The program starts at the end of August, and I can hardly wait!</p>\n","title":"I was Accepted into a Full Stack Developer Training!","date":"2022-08-12"}},"__N_SSG":true}
