This includes all the <strong>physical infrastructure</strong>, which normally becomes a large capital expenditure for a business but can be completely <strong>reduced to an operating expense</strong> when migrating to a cloud hosting environment. This allows businesses to focus on their unique venture without requiring the IT infrastructure and knowledge they had to previously.</p>\n<p>Further, cloud services can help new businesses get off the ground quicker than if they had to create their own infrastructure to host their web servers. For example, a web application can be provisioned and hosted publicly on the web in minutes using AWS Amplify, Elastic Beanstalk or S3 using its static webpage hosting feature.
