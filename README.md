# Personal Portfolio Website Version 2!

Welcome to the second version of my portfolio website! I created this website to showcase my work, host a blog, and provide a method of contact. I decided to make a second version to update the layout, primarily for ease of use and organization, and to practice building with React and Next.js. You may view the live website [here](https://portfolio-website-v2-kappa.vercel.app/)

## How to Install and Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the root directory
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 

## How to Use the Project

Feel free to explore the codebase and make suggestions. I posted the code on GitHub to show an example of a simple portfolio website made using Next.js. 

Happy coding!
