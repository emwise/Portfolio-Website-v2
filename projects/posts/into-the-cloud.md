During the software engineering course at CCC's Wilbur Wright College, the professor mentioned the usefulness of cloud services in modern software development. He specifically introduced us to Amazon Web Services and told us about the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner role, which is achieved by passing an exam with the same name. He told us one of his last students passed that exam and began learning about more advanced topics like building machine learning programs in the cloud. Thus, I began learning about AWS through its online educational tools like AWS Skill Builder. 

The cloud environment is fascinating because of the potential to build **fault tolerant**, **highly available**, **secure**, and surprisingly **cost effective** computing and network architecture. Further, all the tools and power to build highly efficient and dynamic systems are available via a web browser! I love the idea of using **many independent services to build a custom application** tailored to a specific use-case. This allows the application to scale well and to be robust to failure because the services underlying are free to vary without drastically affecting the entire application. 

The more I learn about AWS both conceptually and technically the more inspired I am to build systems myself, and I decided to pursue the Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam. Wish me luck!
