README.md files are as important as a **first impression**. They set the tone for how the project is going to be received and will drum up interest hopefully resulting in interaction with the codebase. Further, the README file is the **guide** explaining how someone would interact and contribute to the project. The README.md is perhaps just as important to the project as the index.js file!  

A README file usually begins with a brief overview of the project and instructions for how to install and run it, and then it continues to describe the project in more detail. It primarily serves to answer important questions such as what, why, how, and so what. For example, a successful README file will answer these questions: 

**What**
-	What problem does the project solve?
-	What is the project trying to accomplish?

**Why**
-	Why build something new to solve the problem? 
-	Why is it important that this project exists?

**How**
-	What technologies does this project use (and why)? 

**So, What**
-	What is the impact of the project?
-	Why should anyone care about the project? 

These questions can be answered within the basic framework of a README.md which usually includes the title, project description, table of contents (if needed), how to install and run the project, how to use the project, credits, and a license section sharing how other people can use or contribute to the project.
