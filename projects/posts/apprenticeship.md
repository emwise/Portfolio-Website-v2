title: 'I was Accepted into a Full Stack Developer Training!'

After applying to many apprenticeships and considering paying for bootcamps with a stroke of luck I received good news! I was accepted into, and will gladly be participating in, a full stack developer apprenticeship program courtesy of the **Discovery Partners Instituteâ€™s TechReady Illinois**, **Cognizant**, and the **City Colleges of Chicago**. I will begin by learning Java in a three and a half month bootcamp course at Wright College, part of the CCC. After, I will interview for an apprenticeship position at Cognizant where I will get to learn fulltime alongside a dedicated mentor and experienced colleagues for another three months.  At the conclusion of the apprenticeship, I will get the **opportunity to interview** for a full stack developer position with Cognizant. 

This apprenticeship is a once in a lifetime opportunity to change careers and become confidently reskilled as a software developer. After learning software development on my own for ten months I am looking forward learning and building applications with a peer group as well as asking instructors and mentors the questions that would usually take me hours to resolve. 

The program starts at the end of August, and I can hardly wait!
