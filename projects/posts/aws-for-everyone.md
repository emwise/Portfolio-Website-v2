One of the main business premises of Amazon Web Services is that they offer to do the "undifferentiated heavy lifting" related to building and maintaining web applications. This includes all the **physical infrastructure**, which normally becomes a large capital expenditure for a business but can be completely **reduced to an operating expense** when migrating to a cloud hosting environment. This allows businesses to focus on their unique venture without requiring the IT infrastructure and knowledge they had to previously.

Further, cloud services can help new businesses get off the ground quicker than if they had to create their own infrastructure to host their web servers. For example, a web application can be provisioned and hosted publicly on the web in minutes using AWS Amplify, Elastic Beanstalk or S3 using its static webpage hosting feature. This is deal for developers and businesses alike!

Overall, there are many ways to leverage a cloud environment to decrease overhead and speed up the development to production workflow. Anyone designing a web app, or even an internal application, should consider the benefits of using the cloud.
